# Quick Start Commands

First time setup:
pnpm setup

Run both backend and frontend together:
pnpm dev

Run individually:
Backend only: pnpm backend:dev
Frontend only: pnpm frontend:dev

# Production Build
npm run build

# Database Setup
pnpm install
npx prisma migrate dev --name AuditDB

# Seed Database (TypeScript files are used)
pnpm seed:actions    # Seed action types (CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.)
# pnpm seed:apikeys   # Seed API keys for microservices (CURRENTLY BROKEN - apiKey model missing from schema)
# pnpm seed:all       # Seed both action types and API keys (partially works)

Note: Only seed:actions is fully functional. The apiKey seeder references a Prisma model that doesn't exist in the schema.
